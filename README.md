# Web Projects
I've been working on some projects to practice my Web Development skills.

Here's a link list of some of them:

- [Web Project 1: News Website](https://github.com/HarllonCS/newswebsite)
- [Web Project 2: Math Solver](https://github.com/HarllonCS/mathsolver)

OBS.: As I save projects on GitHub, I also update the list.

## Web Project: News Website
The idea of this site is to present news of events that circulate in the world. The user will be able to register his e-mail if he wants this news to be delivered to his inbox.
