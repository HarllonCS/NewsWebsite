# Web Projects
I've been doing some projects for studies and practice my Web Development skills.

Here's a link list of some of them:

- [Web Project 1: News Website](https://github.com/HarllonCS/news-website)
- [Web Project 2: Math Solver](https://github.com/HarllonCS/math-solver)

OBS.: As I save projects on GitHub, I also update the list.

# Web Project: News Website
The idea of this site is to present news of events that circulate in the world. The user will be able to insert his e-mail if he wants this news to be delivered to his inbox.

## Header
The **Header** has a *select* feature that changes the language of the page and a *Login* button.

### Login 
The user can login by clicking on the button in the upper right corner. There, a window with email and password fields will appear in the middle of the screen.

## Main Section
The **Main Section** consists of **Email Form** and **News Section**.

### Email Form
The user can put his email in the **Email Form** to receive current news.

### News Section
The most relevant news will appear right away on the Landing Page under the **Header** ([aos](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) animations will be triggered when scrolling).
