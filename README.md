# Web Projects
I've been doing some projects for studies and practice my Web Development skills.

Here's a link list of some of them:

- [Web Project 1: News Website](https://github.com/HarllonCS/news-website)
- [Web Project 2: Math Solver](https://github.com/HarllonCS/math-solver)

OBS.: As I save projects on GitHub, I also update the list.

# Web Project: News Website
The idea of this site is to present news of events that circulate in the world. The user will be able to insert his e-mail if he wants this news to be delivered to his inbox.

## Header
The header consists of the navigation menu and the email form.

### Navigation Menu
In addition to having the site's navigation options, the menu has a "select" that changes the language of the page.

### E-mail Form
The email field and submit button are available to the user.

## Main Section
The most relevant news will appear right away on the Landing Page under the header (aos.js animations will be triggered when scrolling).

## Login 
The user can log in by clicking on the button in the upper right corner. There, a screen with email and password fields will appear in the middle of the screen.

## Register
(In progress...)
